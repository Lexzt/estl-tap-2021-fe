## Issues

### Cors

Currently, I did not handle the CORS security issues and went around the problem with a plugin that disables CORS. An example for firefox is https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/

### GUI CRUD Actions/Test Cases

CRUD actions currently do not have much test cases, I would have put in more time to write those out, but due to time constrain and school commitments, I was not able to do those.

### UI

The UI requires more time and polishing for it to be less finicky. For example, when an edit operation happens, the rows are edited due to my inner operation, but I did not put it back in the same location. More polishing is required for icons, table margins, and more.

### Test Cases

I have wrote some simple test cases for area which I thought would be where testing is most crucial. However, this implementation of testing is not exhasutive by any means and I apologize for that.
