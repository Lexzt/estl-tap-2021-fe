## Issues

### GUI CRUD Actions/Test Cases

CRUD actions currently do not have much test cases, I would have put in more time to write those out, but due to time constrain and school commitments, I was not able to do those.

### UI

The UI requires more time and polishing for it to be less finicky. I would wish to properly apply a proper grid system and style it, but I did not manage to get around to that.

### Test Cases

I have wrote some simple test cases for area which I thought would be where testing is most crucial. However, this implementation of testing is not exhasutive by any means and I apologize for that.
